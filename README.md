# Project Description
**Code Institute: User-Centric Front-End Development**  
  
* I have decided to create a website for a fictional tour here in Ireland.  
However, while the tour is fictional the places featured are real and
this was an idea that I had brought forward for the promotion of tourism in Ireland. 
While the Covid-19 Pandemic has devastated people across the globe; it is hoped that
we will be able to travel all around the world. Meanwhile, I have created this website
to give little idea about the places, so that ones everything comes to normal an option 
for travel would be this country.  
  
* For the purpose of my Milestone 1 project we're going to see attractive places, music ,culture and tour.
  
* On that basis I have used the five planes of UX methodology to identify the user needs, the features required, the most logical way to structure the information and the functionality required for this Milestone project.
