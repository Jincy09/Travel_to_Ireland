# Development Notes:  
  
**Some of the challenges I faced during the Development process and how I addressed them:**  

- One of the main issue I faced is to fix the nav bar. The responsiveness of the navbar was not at all good.
- The next thing I faced was overriding background images, I solved that by giving appropriat height and width to the image.
- I initially added src folder for all the html file, but while deploying background images were not reflecting. My mentor helped me to solve the problem by deleting the src folder.
-  For the Gallery I wanted the a hover the information for respective images but I wasn't sure how to achieve this, then I solved this issue by watching a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b2mTq0Xrtw&t=147s)
